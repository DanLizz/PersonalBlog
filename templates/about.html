                        <p>I was inspired by robotics from various movies and TV shows while I was a kid. I was astonished by the film 'Short Circuit' and wanted to be a robotics engineer from that day onwards. I want to give some positive contribution to society by designing and building something new using technology. It feels really wonderful when you know that you are actually providing something positive to society.</p>
                        <p>I chose to be an engineer because I believe I can find solutions to the problems faced by society using technology. I would like to gain some practical experience from the industry after graduation applying what I have studied till now.</p>
                        <p>I would like to pursue a masterâ€™s in electrical and Computer science majoring in robotics and A.I. My dream is to start a new company within 10 years which provides low-cost technology solutions, especially to differently abled people.</p>
